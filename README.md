# colormatic
A hex value color picker 

# What

Creating a color picker webapp 
The goal is to creat something that can take hex, rgba, or hsla values and provide a swatch and the values in other modes for copy.
An improvement would allow the user to save and add colors to palletes in a sqlite table
An upgrade would be to allow the user to scrape a url for a color pallete

# Why

I want to learn how to implement the flask and ember frameworks. This is a project that I think will allow for some simple functionality and utility that I make use of with regularilty while creating the opportunity to implement successive levels of features to encompase the front and backend. 

# How

The goal will first be to build the app using python and flask with simple functionality, then implement a modern responsive UI using bootstrap.
The second goal will be to rebuild this app using the ember framework for the frontend potentially with a boostrap UI as well.
